Chris van Marle - 2010-2011

These are some settings files I use on different machines

In your home directory execute:
git clone git://github.com/qistoph/Settings.git .settings

Then create links
.settings/mklinks.sh

Existing files will be backed up to <org name>~
These will be overwritting if mklinks is run for a second time!
